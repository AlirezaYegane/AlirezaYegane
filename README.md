# Hi, I'm Alireza 👋

I work somewhere between machine learning and software engineering.  
Most of my recent projects are about anomaly detection on clinical-style datasets and building small tools that I can actually use: planners, dashboards, and simple automations.

- Currently exploring ontology-aware anomaly detection on tabular / EHR-like data  
- Build analytics and reporting tools using Python, SQL, and Power BI  
- Interested in: anomaly detection, clinical ML, generative models, and developer tooling  
- Based in Tehran

## 🔬 Selected ML & research-oriented projects

### Ontology-aware anomaly detection on diabetes encounters
`Python · scikit-learn · Autoencoders · Clinical-style ML`

A small but reasonably structured pipeline for early readmission risk on the *Diabetes 130-US hospitals* dataset.  
The focus is on:

- treating early readmissions as rare / high-risk events  
- comparing classic anomaly detection (e.g. Isolation Forest) with representation-learning approaches  
- preparing the ground for ontology-aware scoring and explainability later on

The repository is written to be readable and reproducible rather than "clever".

### Bone fracture detection (X-ray)
`Python · Deep Learning`

An experimental CNN-based pipeline for detecting bone fractures from X-ray images.  
The goal here is to practice end-to-end modeling:

- minimal preprocessing  
- a simple CNN / transfer learning baseline  
- basic evaluation and error analysis

It is not a production model, but a place to experiment with medical imaging workflows.

## 🧠 Software & tools I build

### Deep Focus Planner (full-stack planning tool)
`FastAPI · PostgreSQL · Next.js 14 · TypeScript · Tailwind · Docker`

A personal planning and productivity app with:

- projects, tasks, and Kanban-style boards  
- daily / weekly planning views  
- some basic analytics over completed tasks  

This project is mainly about keeping a clean full-stack structure (API, database, frontend) and learning how to make something that is usable beyond a single script.

### DNSFUT – DNS benchmarking utility
`Python`

A small DNS benchmarking tool originally built to tune DNS settings for a gaming console.  
It:

- measures response times for a list of DNS servers  
- returns a simple ranking (e.g. Top N choices)  

It started as a practical need, then turned into a place to practice writing small, focused CLI-style tools.

### File manager & problem-solving practice
`Java · Algorithms`

- A simple Java-based file manager to practice OOP and working with the filesystem  
- A collection of algorithm / data structure exercises (e.g. LeetCode-style problems) to keep fundamentals fresh

## 📈 Courses & learning

Some of the material I’ve gone through:

- Machine Learning Specialization – Coursera (Andrew Ng)  
- Other ML / AI courses and self-study notebooks (see the `Coursera---Machine-Learning-Specialization` repo)

I usually try to turn course content into small, runnable projects instead of leaving it as isolated notebooks.

## 🧩 What I'm working on now

- Turning clinical ML research ideas into clean, reproducible code  
- Improving anomaly detection and explainability for EHR-like data  
- Hardening the Planner codebase (tests, better structure, and more reliable deployments)
