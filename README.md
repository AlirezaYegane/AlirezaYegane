# Hi, I'm Alireza 👋

I work somewhere between machine learning and software engineering. Most of my projects are about anomaly detection on clinical-style tabular data and building small tools (planners, dashboards, automations) that I actually use in my own workflows.

## 🔬 Selected ML & research-oriented projects

### Ontology-aware anomaly detection on diabetes encounters  
`Python · scikit-learn · Autoencoders · Clinical-style ML`  
**Repo:** [`ontology-aware-anomaly-detection-diabetes`](https://github.com/AlirezaYegane/ontology-aware-anomaly-detection-diabetes)

A reasonably structured pipeline for early readmission risk on the *Diabetes 130-US hospitals* dataset:

- preprocessing and feature engineering for clinical-style tabular data  
- anomaly baselines (e.g. Isolation Forest, autoencoder-style models)  
- an ontology-inspired rule layer to adjust scores and penalties  
- ROC-AUC / PR-AUC evaluation in a reproducible codebase

The goal is clarity and reproducibility, not “clever” one-off scripts.

### Bone fracture detection (X-ray)  
`Python · Deep Learning`  
**Repo:** `bone-fracture-detection`

An experimental CNN-based pipeline for detecting bone fractures from X-ray images:

- minimal preprocessing for medical images  
- simple CNN / transfer learning baselines  
- basic evaluation and error analysis to understand failure modes  

This is a sandbox for experimenting with medical imaging workflows.

---

### Decision tree classifier from scratch  
`Python · Algorithms · ML fundamentals`

A from-scratch implementation of the ID3 decision tree algorithm:

- full preprocessing pipeline (cleaning, normalization, feature selection)  
- careful implementation of splitting criteria and tree construction  
- evaluation using F1-score and other standard metrics  

Useful as a reference for how I think about implementing ML algorithms beyond libraries.

---

### DEA study: data transmission algorithms  
`Python · Optimization · TOPSIS`

A comparative study of classical vs AI-based data transmission algorithms for a DEA conference:

- ranking algorithms based on accuracy and hardware/resource usage  
- applying the TOPSIS method for multi-criteria decision making  
- written and presented as a research-style study on constrained infrastructure

## 🧰 Software & tools I build

### Deep Focus Planner (full-stack planning tool)  
`FastAPI · PostgreSQL · Next.js 14 · TypeScript · Tailwind · Docker`  
**Repo:** `Planner`

A personal planning and productivity app with:

- projects, tasks, and Kanban-style boards  
- daily / weekly planning views  
- basic analytics over completed tasks  

This project is mainly about learning to keep a clean full-stack structure (API, DB, frontend) and making something usable beyond a single notebook.

---

### DNSFUT – DNS benchmarking utility  
`Python`  
**Repo:** `DNSFUT`

A small DNS benchmarking tool originally built to tune DNS settings for gaming:

- measures response times for a list of DNS servers  
- returns a simple ranking (e.g. Top N choices)  

It started as a practical need and evolved into a place to practice writing small, focused CLI-style tools.

---

### File manager & problem-solving practice  
`Java · Algorithms`  
**Repos:** `File-Manager`, `LeetCodeProblems`

- a simple Java-based file manager to practice OOP and filesystem handling  
- a collection of algorithm / data structure exercises (LeetCode-style problems) to keep fundamentals sharp

---

## 📚 Courses & learning

Some of the material I’ve gone through:

- Machine Learning Specialization – Andrew Ng (Coursera)  
- Advanced Learning Algorithms – DeepLearning.AI  
- Elements of AI – University of Helsinki & MinnaLearn  
- Human Subjects Research Protection – U.S. Department of Health & Human Services  
- Various ML / AI notebooks and side projects (see the `Coursera---Machine-Learning-Specialization` repo)

I generally try to convert course content into small, runnable projects instead of leaving it as isolated notes.
